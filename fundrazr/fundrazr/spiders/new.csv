0,"34,780",Help Victor Beat MS with Stem Cell Transplantation,Canadian Dollar,, $40k ,182.0,"Hello, We are a group of Victor's family and friends and we are trying to
  help him raise funds to finance a trip overseas, to attend a medical
  centre that specializes in Stem Cell Treatments. The exact centre and
  the exact treatment are yet to be determined.This will depend on the
  amount of funds raised. There are many variables involved in this type
  of treatment, each with their own respective cost. An example would
  be, an Autologous  transplant (collecting a patient's own
  blood-forming stem cells), versus an Allogeneic transplant (collecting
  stem cells from a matching donor). Fortunately, it's a very hopeful
  time for people suffering from Multiple Sclerosis and other
  Auto-Immune diseases. There have been many success stories (some of
  which you can view on YouTube). This type of treatment is becoming
  mainstream in many countries around the world. Sadly for Victor,
  Canada is still in its developmental stage. Please take a moment and read a little bit about Victor's life and
  his battle with MS. If you can financially manage a small donation, it
  would be truly appreciated. A donation can be made right from this
  page. Victor will receive 95% of the funds, and this wonderful website
  will receive 5%. Whether you can donate or not, please be so kind as
  to pass this page along, via email or social media, to as many people
  as you can.  We thank you and are grateful for your support. Most of you visiting this fundraising page already know Victor, but
  for those of you who don't please let me introduce him. Victor is 59
  years old and has been fighting an uphill battle with Multiple
  Sclerosis for 26 years. It has been quite a battle but he has always
  fought with courage and grace.  Victor first felt the symptoms of MS
  shortly after completing his first and only triathlon.  Soon after
  that race, he was eager to begin training in hopes of improving upon
  his time in the next race. It was then that the symptoms hit him, and
  they had an immediate and devastating effect.  He went from running 17
  miles a day to not being able to run one block. In 1984, just after completing college, Victor found employment with
  the CIBC in the Savings Application Department as a Programmer. Two
  years later he transferred to Host Facilities as a Programmer.  His
  talents were recognized  and he was promoted to manage a group of 7
  programmers. His team was the infrastructure and the bank's
  applications ran on their software. Victor was prepared to leave the bank due to his MS in 1999 when the
  logistics of getting to work became difficult, but in the year 2000,
  (potential Y2K crisis) he stayed on to ensure all applications ran
  smoothly. Victor left his managerial position shortly after this
  period and is now supported, in part, by longterm disability benefits. In 2010, Victor, his wife Michelle and his brother Tony, all went to
  Egypt to have the CCSVI (Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency) -
  Liberation treatment.  As you can imagine it was a quite an expensive
  endeavor. The physical benefits Victor experienced were remarkable but
  some affects were short lived. At that point, in 2010, Victor hadn't
  been able to move his right leg for many years. Amazingly, just a few
  hours after doctors placed catheters and balloon inflation into his
  collapsed and blocked veins, Victor was able to raise that same leg
  into the air.  When he returned home we could all see improvement and
  thought he was on his way to recovery.  Even his horrific Trigeminal
  Neuralgia pain was greatly reduced. Trigeminal Neuralgia
    is considered to be one of the most painful afflictions known.
    It is characterized by episodes of excruciating stabbing or
    electrical shock-like pains which hit one side of the face. The
    episodes of pain usually last up to two minutes and may occur
    spontaneously or be triggered by light stimulation. Victor has
    endured this affliction daily for over a decade. The CCSVI results lasted for approximately one year.  We believe the
  vein in his neck collapsed and became blocked once more. Due to the
  delicate nature of veins (as opposed to arteries), stents cannot be
  used. There is a risk of the stent becoming dislodged, migrating along
  the blood vessels and becoming lodged in the heart or lungs. Prior to the MS, Victor lived a very healthy lifestyle and continues
  to do so today. Beginning day one, Victor has not benefitted with any
  traditional medicine for his symptoms. In fact all prescribed options
  to manage pain only exacerbated his leg weakness. Research has since
  determined that as varied as MS symptoms may present so too are the
  outcomes with medication for Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis.
  To support his wellness, Victor employs various holistic forms. Some
  of the modalities include: Hyperbaric Oxygen treatments; Live Blood
  Cell Analysis; Reichian therapy; Homeopathy; Naturopathic Medicine; as
  well as following a strict diet and supplement regime. The financial
  impact has been staggering, but Victor attributes his longevity to
  these natural treatments. The driving force that gives Victor strength to endure this battle is
  his love for his family; his wife Michelle, daughter Simone, and son
  Kristian. He once stated to me that if he were able to go back in
  time, he would gladly suffer MS again if it meant he could spend his
  life with Michelle, and participate fully with their children while
  they strive to achieve their own personal and professional
  aspirations.  Victor is proud that both Simone and Kristian are
  excelling in university with a shared goal to positively impact
  healthcare for others. In the bottom left-hand corner of the above profile photo, there is a
  link to additional photos. Please feel free to have a glimpse at the
  amazing life Victor has lived, and is living. We, Victor's friends and family, thank you!",https://fundrazr.com/fundvictor

    participants in Europe. If you are a participant living outside Europe and would like
    to participate, please refer to our American Gut Fundrazr page . Many
  people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play an
  incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them:
  They make up 50 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"".  Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe, as an extension
    of the American Gut Project & The Microsetta Initiative, based
    at the University of California San Diego.  We have collaborated
    with TwinsUK at King’s College London so that those living in Europe
    can participate, and with your help, we will be able to discover
    more about the crucial relationship between our health and our
    microbiome, and on a personal level, you will be able to discover
    the bacterial profile of your own gut. With your help, we hope to be
    able to answer questions such as 'How much does our choice of
    lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and can we alter our
    microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has
    their own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out
    what constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of
    bacteria are beneficial and which ones should be avoided. In order
    to do this ambitious and much-needed project, we urgently need a
    large scale collection of human samples. Over ten thousand people
    have already signed up in America already through the American Gut
    Project-- but we need many more from Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main
    'microbial home', however, the study will also look at areas like
    the oral and skin, as these areas of the body may be influenced by
    the microbiome. Joining is simple! Select the kit you would like from the list
    of options on the left-hand side by clicking “Claim this perk” found
    on the right side (if you would like to receive a specific number of
    kits that isn’t listed as a perk, email us at info@britishgut.org ). You will receive your kit within 3 weeks after payment. Shipping within the U.K. first class should be around £2.90, but
    we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the proper
    postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is important
    since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely not
    produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your
    sample to us, we will then sent it to the Knight Lab at the
    University of California San Diego to be processed and
  analyzed. We typically bulk ship samples back to the Knight
  Lab about every 2 months on dry ice to reduce shipping costs. Once
  your sample arrives at the Knight Lab (you'll get a notification when
  they have received your sample), processing takes 3-4
    months. We estimate that the whole process will take about
    4-6 months. Each kit contains a sample collection device (or multiple if you
    ordered more than one), an instruction packet on how to sample, and
    return envelope(s) to send your sample tube(s) back. Once we provide you with your results, you will receive data
    visualization of how your results compare to other people who are
    within the same diet and lifestyle group as you (having different
    results from them does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can
    just be that you have different lifestyles that make bacterial
    profile is different).   In addition, you will be provided with a
    list of the major groups of bacteria in your sample and their
    relative abundances (based at the genus level). These results are not actionable,
      and we do not provide any personalized interpretation . It will take longer than the expected 4-6 months to receive
      results if you are submitting one of the following sample types: Oral or skin samples. A desktop computer or laptop is recommended to register and log your sample into our
      participant portal website, as our participant website has
      compatibility issues on mobile devices and tablets.  The best
      browser to use when you register your kit is Google Chrome. Note your de-identified information will be part of a
      research study and will be made available in a publicly available
      research database. That is, any personal information that might
      easily identify who you are will be removed before being placed in
      the public database. If you decide that you no longer wish to continue in this
      study, please send a request to the British Gut Project help
      account ( info@britishgut.org ) to inform us of your intent to withdraw. You may request a
      refund within 50 days of your original payment if you have not yet used your kit. Please note that the Fundrazr transaction fee will be
        deducted from your refund. The consent forms are maintained on the participant website;
      details are included in your kit. To sign the consent form, you

4,"153,820",Help James McCarthy in his battle against leukemia,U.S. Dollar,, $100k ,977.0,"How you can help: Donate to James’ care: https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/f1OA33/pay Register to be a bone marrow donor: http://www.bethematch.org/ James’ Story: On Tuesday, August 7th we were leaving the house for Rita’s birthday
  dinner when we received a voicemail from James’ doctor. She said to call immediately and left her personal cell phone
    number. As we walked, James was being his usual self:
  running down Southport Ave and acting like a healthy, happy little
  boy. Forty-eight hours later, James would be in critical
  condition, on a ventilator, and fighting for his life.  Two days after
  that James was diagnosed with an extremely rare form of Leukemia. When we called the doctor back, she shared that a routine blood test
  showed James’ white blood cell count was abnormally high and she
  wanted us to get more tests done by the Leukemia and cancer
  specialists at Lurie’s Children Hospital. To put it in
  perspective, healthy children usually have a white blood cell count of
  5,000 to 10,000. James’ was at 32,000. Thursday was the soonest appointment we could get with a hematologist
  - a doctor who specializes in diseases of the blood. The
  doctors at Lurie’s confirmed that something was not right. They wanted to get a bone marrow sample to figure out what was
  going on and the quickest way to the front of the line was to have
  James admitted. At that point, there wasn’t a high level
  of concern for James’ immediate health. We spent the day
  playing with trucks, reading books, watching “gee” (Curious George)
  and looking at cars, trucks, buses and all his favorite sights of the
  city from the hospital room window. On Friday morning at 9:30 am, James underwent a procedure to extract
  a bone marrow and a bone sample from his hip. The
  doctor’s shared what they were testing for: James likely either had
  Leukemia or an auto-immune disease. Devastation. A few hours later the oncologist (cancer doctor) called us to the
  consultation room for a discussion. She shared what was
  seemingly good news. The initial blood results had ruled
  out the most common types of Leukemia, which typically make up more
  than 99% of annual childhood Leukemia diagnosis. The
  only cancer they couldn’t rule out was a very rare form of Leukemia
  called Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, or JMML. We
  would later learn that JMML is so rare that there are currently only
  20 kids diagnosed in the U.S. While we didn’t yet have an answer for what was affecting James, we
  cautiously celebrated the news since the other options were an auto
  immune disease or pneumonia.  We were told the rest of the tests would
  likely come back on Monday. That night James’ health rapidly deteriorated. His
  temperature spiked to 104. His heart rate was racing at
  200 beats per minute. His lungs began to fail. To help his little body the nurses and doctors put him on
  oxygen and a few IVs. While we were scared – and not
  knowing what was happening – we at least had the benefit of being able
  to talk to the doctors. James didn’t. As the night progressed, the doctor’s wanted to increase his oxygen
  to help with his lungs; and to do so, he needed to be moved to the
  Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and only they could administer
  the higher dosage. For the next 24-hours, James would not rest; his body would not let
    him. Each time he did fall asleep, he would wake up 10
  to 20 minutes later terrified and not knowing what was happening.  His
  body was in overdrive, IVs and sensors all over his body, a tube
  inserted down his nose into his stomach – how could he understand? It was excruciating. His body was being
    overworked. He was having trouble breathing. He was not getting the rest needed. He was
  pleading with all the words he had.  “All done.” “Momma.” “Up.”
  “Outside.” It was heartbreaking and terrifying to watch
  our poor little baby so scared and so sick, feeling completely helpless. The PICU team told us what we could already see.  James’ body
  could not sustain this pace on his own, so we made the decision to
  sedate and intubate him (put on a breathing machine.) It
  was mentally impossible to hear but we knew it had to be done.  We sat
  bedside with James as he was sedated and the breathing tubes inserted
  into his lungs.  This was two days after we walked into the hospital
  with a seemingly healthy little boy. Saturday brought a new bombshell. The only piece of
  good news we had received instantly disappeared. Our
  James had JMML, the rarest type of childhood Leukemia. The doctors now suspected that James did not have pneumonia. Instead it was leukemia filling his little lungs with white
  blood cells. James’ white blood cell count accelerated
  rapidly throughout the day from 30,000 (which we previously thought
  was unimaginably high) to 50,000 to 78,000 to 90,000 to 111,000 to 128,000. Our little James was now in critical condition. Some of
  the best doctors in Chicago were working with him minute-by-minute,
  hour-by-hour to keep him going. Everything had happened
  so fast that we didn’t even have time to process one bit of news
  before we had moved onto another. But we kept in mind
  one thing: if you’ve met James, you know he is a strong-willed little
    toddler. If anyone can battle this, it’s James. While James’ lungs were responding to the breathing machine, it
  wasn’t enough.  The doctors decided to move him to a
  new ventilator that could also administer anesthesia gas in addition
  to breathing for James.  This machine had to be brought up from the
  E.R. and had only been used a few times on the PICU floor over the
  past two years. We were told James may be the sickest
  patient in the hospital (438 patients) and that he was fighting for
  his life. We were grasping for straws. The doctors told us they
  were running out of things to try. We
  discussed unproven options that had never been tried on a patient as
  young as James. We signed consent forms. Fortunately, the new machine began to stabilize James and we took
  some of those options off the table.  During “rounds” the next
  morning we counted thirteen doctors and nurses around James’ room to
  get an update on his condition.  We felt like we were in the right
  place with the right level of attention from an incredibly experienced
  medical staff. We had tremendous support from family and
  friends – all rallying around James and supporting us day and night. On Sunday, August 12th- just 5 days after receiving that urgent
  call from the doctor - James started Chemo. His chemo is
  now administered twice a day. Once for
    30-minutes. Later in the day for 4-hours. He typically also requires a blood transfusion. This is in addition to the 18-25 drips of medication he is on
  every hour. As crazy as it sounds, this is only part of the story over the past
  week. There have been other challenges with blood
  pressure, his lungs filling with carbon dioxide (CO2), scary
  challenges switching him to new medical machinery, but tough little
  James is making progress. On Wednesday the 15th he moved
  to a smaller ventilator. His white blood cells are down
  to 30,000. While still on anesthesia, James has been resting in bed with his
  night time puppy, Curious George stuffed animal and a pacifier in one
  hand and his favorite toy truck in the other. We have
  been reading James books, which is very difficult while keeping your
  emotions in check. James has a long fight in front of him. It’s scary to
  think about all the challenges ahead but right now we are focused on
  today. One step at a time, then we will tackle the next target. Ultimately, the only cure for JMML is a bone marrow transplant, in
  addition to extensive chemotherapy over the coming months until we
  find the appropriate donor match. If you want to see if
  you would be a match for James, please register at the website below. Nearly 5,000 kids will be diagnosed with Leukemia this year. There are a lot of kids like James out there whose only hope is
  to find a good donor match. You can do it from your own
  home and it’s as easy as swabbing the inside of your cheek. Please visit: http://www.bethematch.org/ You can learn more about JMML at: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_myelomonocytic_leukemia Please keep James in your thoughts and prayers.  He’s the
  sweetest little boy you’ll ever meet. We can’t wait to
  hear his voice again. To see his kind blue eyes. To have him blow us a kiss with a smile. I love
    you James. You can donate to James’ care at https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/f1OA33/pay",https://fundrazr.com/f1OA33

    I’m not working, I spend my spare time drawing, watching too many
    movies and quoting Star Wars at every opportunity . Since I hate asking for help myself, a friend offered to write
    something up for me. Thanks for reading. Always in motion is the future. --------------------------- Hi there, I’ve worked with Dylan for a little over a year now.
    He’s hardworking, motivated and always has everyone in tears from
    laughter. It was his drive that led him to get a second job to help
    pay for art school and have some more financial stability. His
    second job was far more physically demanding (he’s a smol boi) but
    he’s not one to let that get in the way. Unfortunately, Dylan recently sustained a pretty serious injury
    - two inguinal hernias - that are in desperate need of surgical
    repair. Due to financial constraints, he’s had to postpone two
    different surgical appointments, as well as pay for several doctor’s
    visits. While he has insurance, it isn’t covering the majority of
    the expenses he’s incurred so it’s had to come out of pocket or be
    put onto credit cards. Two months in, the debt is adding up, the
    problem is getting worse by the day and Dylan is in constant pain -
    physically and mentally. He’s having to miss work across both jobs
    on a regular basis, if not from pain caused by the hernias, because
    of crippling migraines caused by the pain and subsequent stress. Point blank, missing work means he’s not making money. Dylan
    is not someone afraid to work for what he has and what he needs. He
    is in a terrible catch-22, as money is what he desperately needs to
    get the surgery. However, his injuries have made it nearly
    impossible to do so. He has to be cautious doing the simplest tasks
    we all take for granted because every day, as he’s at risk of the
    injury becoming more severe. The doctors have suggested surgical
    repair and recovery time as soon as possible to prevent further injury. Your donations would help Dylan: - cover the initial expenses required for scheduling the
    surgery, including (but not limited to) any pre-op office visits,
    blood work, testing, exams, and covering wages lost due to missing
    work to complete those visits - cover wages lost during the minimum two week recovery time
    after the surgery (due to the nature of his jobs) to pay for bills
    and normal living expenses (i.e. rent, utilities, food, gas,
    insurances, etc) - pay for the cost of double inguinal hernia repair surgery not
    covered by insurance until he is fully recovered and bringing in
    money again - have peace of mind and be able to focus all his energy into
    recovering from his surgery, not worrying about bills or
    insurmountable debts Any and all support is greatly appreciated. If you are unable to
    support, please consider sharing this campaign. Please consider donating so we can have our goofy, fun-loving
    Dylan back. Even more, help Dylan get his life back. Emily --------------------------- P.S. Dylan here, I wanted to offer a piece of commissioned
    artwork for donors over $40 to be able to work to earn the help
    offered here while I get back on my feet. Thanks a bunch. P.S.S. Emily again, proof of medical expenses covered with funds
    raised will be available upon request from organizer. We’ll update

  the project are high and FundRazer is used to allow those who would
  like to make a donation to do so. In 2019 the cost of sunflower seeds came to £144.40, the cost of
  the second class large stamp which is required to post the seeds is
  79p (£294.94 was spent on postage in total) and the cost of envelopes
  was £22.35. Donations can be for as little as £1, so if you like what we do or
  have benefited from the project in some way, please consider
  supporting our work. Any funds raised via FundRazer will be used to

  My first was an ""opps"", I was told i would never get
  pregnant without IVF. So clearly the best most welcomed
  ""opps"" in history. He is 10 now. Brilliant, funny, sweet
  inspiration and inspired himself to be an entrepreneur and a
  scientist. 5 years of fertility treatment later came my daughter. She
  is a ball of energy strong willed fierce little beast. She will one
  day rule the world. Hopefully it won't be post-apocalyptic but if it
  is be sure she'll save the cats! Like most women with MS who are also
  mothers with each of my my children came more symptoms. After my son
  was born the doctors were so surprised to see a case of
  pregnancy-related carpal tunnel after the baby was born. And the leg
  drop symptoms were attributed to my first epidural coming out of my
  back and the second one not working. Fast forward 2 years and moving
  across country with the 18 month old. I had a stress induced bout of
  optic neuritis. I was told that ""losing my sight in my right eye
  was a great thing because it made it so much easier for them to
  diagnose my MS""! Luckily after my first round of steroid
  infusions my sight came back. I get to see my beautiful children and
  be reminded of what a blessing it is to have your sight. Now I'm not
  going to say I want to lose my hearing but some days I would be okay
  with that but my sight is so valuable to me even more so having had
  the experience of not known if I was going to keep it completely.
  (While trying to write this my kids have been arguing about how to
  break out of prison, they are playing video games together, the
  Miracle of summer break)! Fast forward a few more years, a few more moves around the country
  (Indiana, Massachusetts, Ohio, Massachusetts, Maryland). If you cant
  tell im from Massachusetts where all my family is. I reset for
  strength and the typical East Coast uptight boss b**** that i was born
  to be. Thanks to my grandmother who was a twin born on Halloween who
  later gave birth to 7 daughters who all run the show. I cant go back
  to live in Boston. My marriage has come to an end. I cant move out of
  state without risking loosing custody. Not being able to share a bed
  because if you accidentally touch someone's legs they cry and just not
  being the nurturing type takes it's toll. We may say ""in sickness
  and in health"" but no one really thinks of what that actually
  means. No one plans to be sick or have a partner who becomes sick.
  There is no what to expect when your wife has MS book. Hell there's no
  what to expect when I have MS book. You can't even get a doctor to
  answer a question half the time because of the answer is always
  ""MS is different for everyone"". Talk about infuriating! So
  now im a single mom living in Maryland below the Mason-Dixon line the
  HOT humid south. Being a white woman over 35 getting divorced has its perks. Welcome
  to the crazy cat lady phase of life!! Before I could only have 2 cats.
  Right now in my house is 9! Like the number of lives they say cats
  have! I actually started a small cattery with my children Assassin
  Kitty Cattery, kittens so cute they kill. We are all about drop dead
  adorable cats. It has given me and the kids something to focus on
  other than divorce, we have a common goal and family focus. My son is
  Mr. Science so its been an awesome  experiment for him as well. We
  breed Scotish Kilts a cross between munchkins and Scottish Folds. They
  track how many are folded, short, both or just cats. They have been a
  blessing to us during this transition. I even groom them myself, I've
  mastered the lion cut. I actually hope to get a license in pet
  grooming with the help of the Alinker. Motherhood, multiple sclerosis, and divorce are all things that came
  at me out of left feild (although motherhood was always wanted). I've
  been doing my best to keep rolling with the punches and stay me and
  keep growing and evolving with and to my circumstances. Even started
  driving for Lyft and Uber to pay the bills. I was voted best driver in
  Baltimore in my first year! But that has taken a toll on me and I need
  to get back at my drawing board and roll on. I'm hoping to live my
  passion for food and healthy baking and create my own breed of cats
  and even start trying some open mic nights at some comedy spots. It's
  strange how the more that things get thrown at you, the more freedom
  you can feel. I fell so much gratitude for the things that I do have
  and appreciation for the good times. Im ready to get out and own my
  world and my life and make it the best it can possibly be. I look
  forward to my new partner in crime too, hello crazy yellow banana Alinker! One of the most humbling things about having MS is having to ask for
  help. It gets easier and the gratitude grows too. Im thankful for what
  i can still do but im greatful for all who are willing to help take
  some of the load from time to time. Thanks for taking the time to know me a little. Alicia",https://fundrazr.com/Mommasonaroll

And, if you haven’t heard already, please visit my website at https://peanutbutterandcancer.com/ for the full shebang. For those of you that may not be able to visit the website... Here’s the skinny. I have brain cancer. I know what you’re feeling, shock, me too
    when I first found out. It started when I was in North Carolina visiting my mom who was
    having a benign brain tumor removed on October 18th. (She’s
    recovering great.) While there, I began having some difficulty
    reading, super aggressive vomiting, and ultimately a raging
    headache. This lasted for a couple of days. My Nanny fortuitously
    took me to the ER in our hometown to, at the very least, get some
    fluids. During that visit, the docs did a CT scan which showed
    evidence of pressure on my brain and the team recommended further
    testing. So I flew back to Denver, CO on October 23. Noah (my
    husband) and I went to Porter ER for follow up. An MRI revealed a
    mass in my brain and they suggested immediate surgery. On 10/25 I
    underwent a successful surgery to remove the visible portions of the
    25mm mass and the tissue was sent out for testing. I was released
    from the hospital on 10/28. On November 1st, I found
    out I have the deadliest of all 120 types of brain tumors, Stage 4
    Glioblastoma (GBM). And... about 3 weeks ago we received some exciting news.  I tested
  positive for cytomegalovirus (CMV).  Which means the CVM is
    found in 60% of all GBMs.  It's also found in the stem cells of all
    GBMs.  This gives us reason to think the cause of the cancer could
    be from a virus. Which we are currently treating with antiviral
    medications. So, in a world of medicine that's not quite sure what
    to do with GBMs, this gives us a place to start. So, we got some fighting to do, huh? Here’s what treatment looks like. First I radically changed my diet (bye bye sugar and peanut butter) Then we started taking every supplement under the sun that is
    rumored to have anti-cancer properties. After consulting our naturopathic oncologist and nutritionist,
    we've narrowed down what supplements work for me.  Luckily, I've
    been able to take less pills. Yay! We've done the radiation and the first round of chemo. I'll
    still be doing small doses of chemo for the next 6 months. I’ve also been doing a number of alternative and spiritual
    treatments: sound bath, reiki, acupuncture Soon I’ll be starting Optune. (This is the part where I shave my
  head). You can check it out here if you want more info ... https://www.optune.com/ This is what I'll look like with the Optune on What I need from you. Send positive vibes. If you believe in Quantum Physics, you know
    energy can heal. Forward any contacts or resources you may have surrounding
    successful GBM treatments. Consider a monetary donation. Unfortunately, stupid cancer isn't
    cheap. GBM is like a needy, expensive house guest that doesn't know
    when to leave. If you feel compelled to donate, we appreciate your contribution.",https://fundrazr.com/pbandcancer

  Pool, and continually disagreed about our football teams (another story). Keith Hancock had had a varied life, including a long career as a
  popular Folk Singer and many of the people who enjoy that scene,
  remember him as the writer and composer of the Folk Standard, Absent Friends. Keith eventually took residence in Ho Chi Minh around the same time
  that I moved to Saigon in 2013 and has used his life experiences to
  colour the lives of the people here in Saigon with his writing and his
  reflection on life, ever since. On the morning of Tuesday 25th June this year, Keith suffered a
    heart attacked and was admitted to the ICU at the Heart Foundation
    in Saigon. where they advised him that he urgently needed an operation. There is no provision for a National Health Service in Vietnam.
    The cost of the surgery plus hospital care and ongoing medication
    will be $8000. We have to raise this money before they will operate.
    Time is imperative. We are asking his family, his friends from

    actively sharing this appeal to their friends, fellow musicians,
    Folk followers and any wider circle. Any donation will be gratefully accepted. Keith desperately
    needs this procedure to repair the damage to his heart and to
    provide any chance of living out a full and fruitful life. If there is any surplus money after all costs are met, it will
    be donated to the Children's Heart Foundation at the same hospital.

     Some of you may be aware in April of this year my mother, Judy, was
    told by her physicians that the breast cancer she fought hard to rid
    her body of in 2008 through 2009 has returned and is attacking her
    bones.  It is currently on a femur, in her tailbone,  shoulder,
    neck, some parts of the spine, and her lower skull. We were excited
    to learn through scans none of her organs have been affected. And we
    want to keep it that way! She began a 10 day treatment of radiation two weeks ago. Now she is
  waiting for her white blood cell count to recover so she may begin the
  oral chemo treatment called Ibrance. Ibrance is a very costly
  prescription. After insurance, it costs $2235.00 for a 21 day supply.
  This prescription could possibly need to be administered for the next
  year. I hope that we can all rally around my parents at this time so
  they will not have to refinance their home in order to pay for this
  lifesaving medicine. The cost of this one drug for a year is  close to
  $30,000. The first month is covered and then we have 30 days to band
  together before the bills hit for each new month’s prescription.  This
  is not including her other medications and treatments. My mom is determined to win this battle once more. Tom and Judy are
  confident the Lord is walking her through this journey  and the
  Father’s amazing healing works will be demonstrated mightily. Thank you for your donations and prayers! Every little bit will help
  my mom continue to fight the good fight. Please follow this page at

  Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) .  Only 5,000 per year in the United
  States are diagnosed with this disease and because the cancer is
  caused by a chromosomal change, there is no way to cure it - only
  medication to keep it at bay.  At the age of 33, it is extremely rare
  for someone like Drew to have this form of leukemia.  It is normally
  diagnosed in people with an average age of 67, and the life expectancy
  is approximately 15 years. There are currently a lot of unknown facts
  surrounding Drew's case because physicians and oncologists do not
  often see CML in someone so young and because of Drew's young age, his
  life expectancy is unknown. What is known, is that Drew needs to take a maintenance chemo
  drug/pill each day to manage the CML for the rest of his life, or
  until a cure is discovered.  There are only a few drugs available at
  this time to treat this disease and Drew's body has already rejected
  3.  He is on the last and 4th drug that is available at this time and
  because it is so rare the demand for the drug is low.  The medication
  he is on now comes from Switzerland, the only place it is made.  The
  doctor orders it through a lab in New Jersey, it is then
  mailed directly to Drew. This medication is not available through a pharmacy. Because of the low demand, the cost for Drew's medication is
  approximately $11,000 per/month.  Medical Insurance and grants pay a
  portion of the entire cost of the drug, so Drew is faced with finding
  funding to make up the balance.  This disease has been an incredible
  financial strain on Drew and his wife Val. With this medication comes
  side effects that he must manage.  Drew has met this challenge with
  his usual strength of determination, peace of soul, his faith in God
  and warm and loving demeanor. Drew is very grateful for the prayers and financial support people
  have shown him in the past.  Financially, the importance of any
  monetary gifts cannot be overstated.  It has allowed him to pay for
  the medication to keep him alive.  From a faith viewpoint, he cannot
  thank you all enough for your prayers.  He knows from experience that
  prayer works.  During this last year when weeks of side effects have
  kept him in bed unable to work, he felt your love and prayers.",https://fundrazr.com/exjqd

    creative process and its many forms. I love trying new things
    because I'm always up for a good challenge. However, I'm facing a
    pretty big challenge of a different sort currently and would really
    appreciate your help. I've lived with mobility issues since the age of
    nine, because of multiple spinal issues, but mostly due to multiple
    arachnoid cysts filled with fluid at the base of my spine which are
    compressing my nerves. I've had surgery to drain it in 2001, and it
    was stable for many years but recent MRIs have shown that it's
    become filled with fluid once again. Medically, I'm figuring out
    what my options are at the moment. In October of 2015, I woke up to feeling like there was a
    piece of tape stuck to the bottom of my right foot. Since then I've
    had multiple EMGs and MRIs done and am still left with not a lot of
    answers or solutions. Due to a combination of my complicated case
    and the scar tissue from my previous surgery, multiple neurosurgeons
    have told me they're not comfortable attempting another... so I'm
    left with a situation I need to find my own solution for. To get an idea of what I'm working with here, here's a picture
    of a ""healthy"" spine vs my spine: If you feel like deciphering doctor language, here's my most
    recent MRI report: ( Right-click on the pic > Open image in new tab to see it at full resolution) In summation: YIKES. What does this mean for me currently? Chronic Pain Numbness in my right foot makes it so I can't
      feel the floor when I go to take a step, therefore, balance issues I haven't been able to walk without a cane
      since 2016 I'm not able to walk very far, even with a
      cane, so I've been essentially housebound for these last few
      years, and boy, would I love not to be! I'm reliant on my brother and sister-in-law
      for anything that requires me to leave the house. (They are the
      best and don't mind, but I'd rather not have to!) So... What would the Alinker do for me? I'd be able to leave the house by myself(!!!) I could go get the mail! Grocery stores would once again be within my reach Unlike a wheelchair, I'd be able to rebuild
      and maintain muscle tone in my legs Be able to have a conversation while walking
      again instead of using all my energy focusing on trying not to fall I could enjoy my time at events, festivals,
      family trips, etc. without feeling like I'm slowing everyone down Having a seat with me at all times would be a
      dream come true I could explore the neighborhood and all its
      cool historic sites I could take my nieces to the park I could walk the family dog I would be closer to being as cool as Selma Blair It really would give me so much freedom back,

  VA working at a nonprofit animal welfare organization in the
  Shenandoah Valley (yep, the same one the sad song is about). I was
  privileged as a young adult to spend time in safe spaces, and I found
  the latitude to question my gender. While I was described as a tomboy
  in my childhood, there is perhaps more to the story as an adult. The Challenge: I am deeply rooted to nonprofits and
  cause-based work, leaving little time and energy left towards pure
  capital gain. That said, over my years of questioning, researching,
  listening to trans people’s personal journeys, and amplifying voices
  where and when I can, surgery is going to be part of my transition to
  greater comfort in my own body and my own skin. While I find it
  difficult to put into language the nuance of how I feel in my body,
  the long and short of it is that I’m very uncomfortable with some of
  its features that cannot be the shape I feel they should without top surgery. The Goal: The purpose of this fundraiser is to raise
  money to pay for my top surgery. Donations will go directly to getting
  something off my chest so I can continue my work in the nonprofit

  was discovered that her kidneys were failing. She was diagnosed with FSGS, which causes scarring in the tiny
  filters in her kidneys, rendering them useless. Several medications
  were used in an attempt to slow the progress of the disease but her
  body did not respond.  This past November she had a dialysis catheter
  placed and started dialysis. She does her dialysis at home and has so
  much responsibility between her daily 14 hour dialysis routine, many
  medications, strict diet and weekly clinic appointments. As her health
  declined, she has maintained a part time job and has taken classes at
  community college as she wants to become a registered nurse. She has
  nowhere near the stamina a 19 year old should have but she pushes
  herself so hard. Wait time for a type O kidney in Michigan is 5-5 1/2 years. As a
  parent it is gut wrenching to watch her suffer the fatigue, constant
  nausea, and occasional depression. A suitable live donor has not been

19,"5,510",Miles Turns Two,U.S. Dollar,, $5k ,49.0,"Miles was born at 9:35PM on June 8, 2017 at Advocate Lutheran General
  Hospital, and it was quickly discovered that something wasn't quite
  right. Miles was gasping for air and showing signs of seizures, and he
  was almost immediately whisked away to the NICU for what would be his
  home for months to come. After four, long days of tests, x-rays, and
  more pokes than one newborn should ever have to endure, it was
  discovered that Miles's ALP levels were ""immeasurable"" and
  many of his bones were so under-mineralized, that they didn't even
  show up on x-ray. While we didn't have genetic confirmation at this
  point (that would come a few weeks later), Miles was diagnosed with
  Infantile Hypophosphatasia - or HPP for short. With his essentially
  nonexistent ALP, Miles is unable to mineralize bones properly. His
  body also struggles with breaking down B6, which cause him to suffer
  from B6 responsive seizures. Thankfully for Miles and the rest of us,
  there is an enzyme replacement therapy that was recently approved by
  the FDA. Miles received his first injection on June 23. It took about two months to start to see some development in Miles's
  bones. His skull that was referred to as ""bone buds"" when he
  was born was finally starting to mineralize. His ribs that looked like
  toothpicks on the first x-ray were showing some strength. We had no
  idea for these first couple of months if the enzyme replacement
  therapy would work. And these x-rays were the first real sign of hope
  because by the end of July, Miles had tired himself out from his
  short, shallow breathing and found himself intubated. After much
  discussion with his doctors, Miles had surgery to get his trach and
  g-tube on August 9. Now you'd think that with a ventilator helping him breathe and the
  enzyme replacement therapy helping him mineralize his bones, we would
  have started to see marked improvement in Miles. But that wasn't the
  case. Miles continued to struggle. Growing bones is apparently quite
  painful (I mean even the great Harry Potter thought so). After some
  advocating by his wonderful nurses, Miles was given a morphine drip
  for the pain. He was also on a number of sedative drugs. It took until
  November, at over 5 months old, for Miles to be weaned off of his IV
  drips and have his central line removed. Even after his central line
  was removed, it took until December for him to be weaned completely
  off of morphine. And on January 16, 2018, after 222 days in the NICU, Miles was
  finally stable enough to come home. But this wasn't the end of Miles's
  medical adventures. Miles came home 100% ventilator and oxygen
  dependent. He also was fed entirely through a g-tube and never took a bottle. For the past year and a half, Miles has made major strides. He's
  learned to sit unassisted, to crawl, and even bear weight on his once
  broken legs. He's grown strong enough to start weaning off the vent.
  And he's begun taking some food by mouth. But Miles still has a
  lifetime of obstacles to overcome thanks to his HPP. For Miles's second birthday, we are raising money for Soft Bones.
  Soft Bones is an amazing organization that has helped us so much in
  Miles's first two years of life. They offer support and resources to
  HPP patients and families. They fund research to help better the lives

  tell you the rest of our story. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) has
  become our daily life. It’s the genetic condition most likely to kill
  children under six years of age, and our daughter has it. It’s a
  progressive lower motor neuron disease, that is loosely paralleled to
  adult ALS. But there are significant differences: most notably, SMA
  never affects cognition, so our daughter is as bright and keen as any
  other child her age. At 14 months, Hannah took her first 3 steps. She has never walked
  since then. After those first steps, she lost any strength to walk,
  then strength to pull up to stand, and then the strength to crawl. She
  can barely get from a lying position to a sitting position. Hannah is
  our mature little scholar! But she is completely dependant on us for
  dressing, toileting, and getting her in her wheelchair.But those
  things aren’t the worst. She is at an extreme risk of respiratory
  failure. Every single simple cold/viral infection is a threat. At
  least three times a year these infections strike hard enough to send
  her to the hospital. As a parent, I weep and get nauseous just
  thinking about this. I don’t want to think about what the next year
  could hold for her. But the amazing thing is that it doesn’t have
  to be that kind of year for our little girl. For over two decades
  the gene responsible for SMA has been known but there has not been a
  single available treatment. This past summer the first drug in history
  to specifically treat SMA was approved ! It is called Spinraza
  (Nusinersen). It can completely halt SMA in its path and even lead to
  some GAIN in muscle strength! This drug truly is a miracle, and
  we need our daughter on it as soon as possible. Though it’s
  approved Spinraza won’t be available on our drug plans for another
  year. It costs $177,000 to provide a year’s supply for Hannah 3 vials
  . The manufacturer, Biogen, will sell it directly to families willing
  to pay for it. This treatment WILL stop Hannah's respiratory deterioration, keep her
  hands strong, and prevent future problems in her spine that would
  require surgery.And we don’t even know what gains it might provide.
  Instead of a year of atrophy it can become a year of miracles! But we
  need your help. We do everything we can for our little girl but we
  can’t do this alone. We need to raise $177,000. Please join us
  on our journey and help to make this a year of miracles for Hannah",https://fundrazr.com/HannahsHeroes

    collecting microbiome samples and rich phenotypic data from
    populations across the globe. The Human Microbiome Project and other microbiome projects
    worldwide have laid an important foundation for understanding the
    trillions of microbes that inhabit our bodies and their impact on
    health and disease. However, opportunities for the public to get
    involved in such research have been limited. Now, American Gut gives
    you an opportunity to join this research project and learn what’s
    living on and inside you. American Gut is a project built on the open-source, open-access
    principles of the Earth Microbiome Project. The data we collect is
    de-identified and then deposited into open repositories for the
    benefit of other researchers and scientists.  By participating in
    our project, you can help contribute to research that will help the
    world understand how the microbiome affects our health. In exchange
    for your participation, we generate a report summarizing the types
    of microbes observed in your sample, and how your sample relates to
    other people in the study. While American Gut mainly focuses on the gut as this is where
    most of our microbes reside, we will also look at areas like the
    oral and skin, as these areas of the body also contain microorganisms. Some examples of what we have found using our data: Younger
  children tend to have more proteobacteria composing their microbiome.
   As you grow older, the diversity of your microbiome increases. (Based off our preliminary findings in 2014,
      found here ) There’s a significant difference between the types of bacteria
    found in industrialized populations vs. non-industrialized populations. McDonald et al. mSystems . May 2018. DOI: 10.1128/mSystems.00031-18 If You Live in the U.S.: Joining is
    simple! Select the kit you would like from the list of options on
    the right-hand side by clicking “Claim this perk” (if you would like
    to receive a certain number of kits that isn’t listed as a perk,
    email us at info@americangut.org ) . Your kit
    will arrive via USPS within 2 weeks after payment, unless you have added the “Priority Shipping”
    perk along with your kit. If You Live in Europe: Visit our sister site, British Gut , to join. If You Live in Australia or Singapore: While we do have sites set up in Australia and Singapore (known
    as Australian Gut and Asian Gut respectively), we ask that participants contribute an additional $25 on top
    of their contribution, which covers an international shipping fee . These sites allow participants to send their samples back to a
    local site, which then sends the samples back to our lab in the U.S.
    to reduce the costs of shipping. If you live in Australia or Singapore and would like to
    participate, claim a perk.  The next page will have an option to
    ""top off"" your contribution with an additional amount,
    which you will use to add in the $25 to mark your kit to go out. I f you do not include the $25 shipping fee, your kit will not be
      sent out until we have received it. Once we have received your transaction, we will forward your
    information to our collaborators. They will then send out a kit to
    you, which you will receive within 3 weeks . Please note that the r eturn time for results will take significantly longer than the
    expected 3 months for Australian/Asian Gut participants. The reason
    is that we have to bulk ship samples on dry ice back to our lab at
    UC San Diego.  This costs thousands of dollars per shipment, so it’s
    only feasible to do once enough samples are ready to ship. If You Live Anywhere
    Else: International participants are also
    welcome to join. The $25 international shipping fee also applies (which you must include in your contribution), along with other regulations . I f you do not include the $25 shipping fee, your kit will not
      be sent out until we have received it. We also ask that samples are shipped back to our lab within 48 hours of being collected. The cost of shipping to our lab in the U.S. from some
    locations can be expensive , so it is recommended that you look into the cost of return
    shipping (it is highly suggested to use FedEx as it is more
    reliable). If you are interested in learning the process of our project
    from start to finish, we have a video available here . Each kit contains a sample tube (or more, if ordered), an
    instruction manual on how to register your kit and take a sample,
    credentials to access our participant website, and return
    envelope(s) to send your sample back. Your results will provide a general overview of how your microbial profile
    compares to other participants ( these results are not intended to be medically actionable,
      and we cannot provide any personalized interpretation ). You will also receive a list of the microorganisms found in
    your sample and their relative abundances (based at the genus
    level).  Results are uploaded via our participant website, which you
    will get access to once you register your kit. For stool samples, it will take about 3-4 months for you to receive your results, and longer for those who are
      participating outside the U.S. (due to shipping procedures to send
      samples back to our lab, which is based at the University of
      California San Diego).  It takes approximately significantly
      longer (5+ months) to receive results if you submit one of the
      following sample types: Oral or skin samples . A desktop computer or laptop is recommended to register and log your sample into our
      participant portal website, as our participant website has
      compatibility issues on mobile devices and tablets.  The best
      browser to use when you register your kit is Google Chrome . Note that your de-identified information will be part of a
      research study and will be made available in a publicly available
      research database. That is, any personal information that might
      easily identify who you are will be removed before being placed in
      the public database. If you decide that you no longer wish to continue in this
      study, please send a request to the American Gut Project help
      account ( info@americangut.org ) to inform us of your intent to withdraw. You may request a
      refund within 50 days of your original payment if you have not yet used your kit. Please note that the Fundrazr transaction fee will be

  12th birthday is coming up on June 21st and the only thing I can think
  of that he needs is a manual ceiling lift. This will help us safely

  been getting bed baths for a year now despite having a rolling bath
  chair and a walk in shower to use because it is no longer safe for us
  to lift him especially when he is wet from the shower. He also goes
  many places throughout the week (church, therapy, and family outings)
  and we do not want him to be limited from these activities because we
  can no longer lift him and put him in his wheelchair. We do not want
  him to become bed bound. We have found a manual ceiling lift and track

  unintentional target in a gun shooting. In the aftermath that
  followed, he was ultimately rendered paralyzed from the chest down and
  wheelchair bound. The shooter’s bullet was meant for his cousin, but
  he was caught in the crossfire, an irony, since he had lived as a law
  abiding citizen his entire life; making his goal to stay clear of
  drugs and violence, unfortunately it became his nemesis. Zuberi lived a very positive and active life before, which he still
  maintains since the tragedy. Albeit, he grew up in the inner city and
  managed to avoid major incidents of violence involving guns, drugs and
  gangs. He knew it was incumbent to remain focused on his goals of
  living a very disciplined life by never drinking alcohol or using any
  kind of drugs, thus avoiding conduits possibly predisposing themselves
  such a tragic outcome. Zuberi at the very time of the shooting worked
  three jobs, seven days a week, while raising two children along with
  pursuing his goals and dreams of being an entertainer (actor, model,
  dancer, rapper and writer). Post the immediacy of the incident, he has
  survived two life threatening surgeries with his heart stopping twice
  on the operating table. Afterwards, and as he convalesced, while
  bedridden for a year, with countless prayers, tears, family and
  community support, he regained physical strength and emotional
  resiliency (although punctuated by intense, constant, and chronic pain
  related to the remaining bullet fragments in his spinal cord and
  chest; 25 years post-incident, he continues to endure the never-ending
  constant, excruciating, chronic, physical pain induced by the bullet
  fragments that remained in his spine). Once stabilization period peaked Zuberi began volunteering by
  mentoring to youth, doing motivational speaking engagements, at
  numerous schools, churches, and social programs; ALL at his own
  expense never charging a fee for his services! Desirous of furthering
  his formal education, Zuberi went back to school and began to
  matriculate his degree and in May, 2000 he was conferred with a
  Bachelor of Arts degree in History Education from Clark Atlanta
  University in Atlanta, Georgia. Currently Zuberi has a T4 Spinal Cord injury, as well as bone on bone
  cartilage wrist damage, as a result of 25 years of confinement in his
  wheelchair and years of operating his wheelchair manually. His
  recommended treatment for his condition is Stem Cell Treatment and
  Rehabilitation. He is requesting this project be funded As Soon As
  Possible in order for him to benefit from this crucial and essential
  surgery. In addition, he is a prolific writer and film producer with
  an ultimate goal to complete his book and documentary projects titled,
  “Dreaming Beyond My Circumstances”; highlighting  his “ tragedy to
  triumph” story to encourage others that no matter what their adversity
  in life or circumstances they live with, to never give up. Zuberi
  hopes to exemplify that you can still make it no matter your
  circumstances. He wants to shout from the mountaintops, “Just don’t
  give up on your dreams, goals and aspirations, and NEVER give up the
  fight!” His ultimate goal is to walk, dance and run again through this
  vital Stem Cell Treatment. On behalf of Zuberi Mwanathaura, we wish to Thank You in advance for
  your prayers, your financial support, your love and sharing his story
  through social media, and with your friends & families. Please join us in our campaign to Help Zuberi Walk Again in 2019!! Speech in link below of Zuberi doing a Motivational Speech to High

    understand who, what, when, where and most importantly why. Who: Stan Romanek is an ordinary man who experiences
    Extraordinary events. Stan is an innocent individual who has been
    convicted of a horrendous crime. A crime against children. Stan
    maintains his innocence, and his friends and family stand by his
    side knowing he would never harm a child, not even by looking at
    pictures of abuse by others. Stan is a father,stepfather, step-Papa, husband, brother, son,
    friend and a lifeline of understanding & support to many people
    around the world. What: It all began in Dec. 2000 when Stan witnessed and
    documented his first UFO. His experiences of contact with ETs/UFO's
    still continues just not as often. More....What: Over the past 17 years Stan has endured threats,
    physical assaults, being shot at, called a fraud and worse. Stan has also received love, praise, thanks, respect, from
    around the world, and according to some a little fame. Netflix
    movie, EXTRAORDINARY:The Stan Romanek Story is a documentary about
    his life and experiences. In 2013 A detective named Koopman arrived at Stan's home with
    a search warrant, an armed SWAT Team, and 2 persons from a forensics
    lab. The team spent 2 1/2 hours in his home, searching. They found
    no evidence of what they were searching for. ( What...Child Porn) No
    disk, no jump drive, no picture, or any trace on any computer!!!! When: April 2013...search warrant When: February 2014 Stan was arrested. He spent 12 hours in
    jail. That's how long it takes to bail someone out. When: 4 1/2 years after the search warrant, August 2017 Stan
    was found guilty of possesion of CP by a 12 member jury. Stan does not blame the jury. They weren't give all of the
    evidence in this case. They weren't allowed to know that Det.
    Koopman had faced his own felony charges in 2016 for basically lying
    to a judge in a murder case pre-trial. He was found not guilty.
    However, the detective was placed on a Brady list. A list for police
    officers who lie in their official capacity. No one could tell the jury about this in Stan's trial, they
    didn't know of the other cases the Det. lied in or that there were 2
    civil lawsuits against the detective. A lot of evidence and witnesses provided for Stan's defense
    was not allowed or were limited in what they could say. This is not how the justice system us supposed to work.
    Innocent people found guilty and guilty people found innocent???? Where: Loveland Colorado, Larimer County. Why: WHY DID THIS HAPPEN TO STAN?? The reason is simple. Silence the messenger! Our therory is that the evidence found 10 months after the
    search warrant was planted. The evidence proves our therory!!!
    Evidence not seen by the jury! How: Malicious activity!!! Virus with backdoor access, a bad
    cop, a dark agency bent on silencing Stan, someone who simply didn't
    agree with Stan's message of the ET/UFO reality????? Who knows!?! The end of this Story is still to be written. On October 19, 2017 Stan will appear in court for sentencing. Nothing can change that fact. The judge is a good judge, and
    Stan's fate is in her hands. What can be done to finish this Story? Please share this
    fundraiser. Donate whatever amount you can, and assist Stan in
    getting an appeal. Justice for Stan is our mission. Do you Stand with Stan? #IStandWithStan PAYPAL Donations: lisaromanek@yahoo.com Thank you, blessings, love and gratitude to you all!",https://fundrazr.com/d1HMsc

  our medical expenses incurred so far (+/-9,500,-US $) as well the cost
  of living / debt accumulated during the time of the illness and

  2017 until Maria and a local good Samaritan, Francisco Lopez, reached
  out at the Baja Nomads forum and made the
  situation known at the beginning of May 2018. Them folks made already
  a HUGE impact on our life. Having everyday ""real"" food
  (prior eating for weeks beans & rice or Marushan), all medical
  supplies required and having made some payments to most pressing debt
  collectors, have electricity and communication secured. All this is
  already a big relieve creating some breathing space. Also here

  until August 2017 when we had to see phone with camera used. Please be
  aware - some of this images are VERY graphical and not for everybody's
  stomach to view!!! Album - Gallery until August 2017 here on Google documents . We have genuinely tried during the past 18 month to progress yet the
  combination of advancing the healing with ambulant treatment (the
  first 6 month 2-3x per week hospital visits), the cost of medication,
  medical supplies and transportation, basic cost of living - rent,
  electricity, telefon, food was in dimensions to large to cope for us.

  family and patient play areas and even gifts for each patient to bring home! When Elsie had her emergency surgery she was not nervous at all and
  that is thanks to all of the incredible staff. They treated her and my
  husband like FAMILY. She now has a book that she brought home upon her
  release and points it out and says 'that's what I got from the
  hospital'. To some this may not be much but to us, it means she
  doesn't remember the bad or scary. When Emma's surgeon came out to tell us the good news I had that
  moment you see on T.V where all you can do is break down and cry and
  hug them. The staff was nothing short of the BEST. As Emma & Elsie still continue their road to 'recovery' we hope
  to continue receiving great news & bless the staff at the next
  follow up with boxes of books & toys! If you have had a similar experience please feel free to join us in
  helping give back to those who made our stay at Lurie as pain free as possible.",https://fundrazr.com/01WHXb

  disease, It is the computer of your brain that effects all your
  organs, I had a minor heart attack and minor heart surgery, I had
  Chemo and IVIG and nothing has worked.  This disease has no cure nor
  has any treatment just comfort measures.  This disease has left me
  with lupus and gastroporesis.  I was a nurse and that is what I was
  meant to be, but had to go on disability.  I can have drop attacks,
  this is where you pass out for no reason, Also have dysautonomia,
  Pots.  Small and large tissue nueropathy.  I can't go for a walk
  around my block or go into a store, you see I have to sit a lot, 
  every few steps and business don't have chairs sitting around.  Also
  the cement kills my legs, If I go somewhere like Costco I pay for
  weeks due to the floor.  This bike to me is amazing, being able to go
  out of the house!  I am basically home bound, If I go out I have to
  choose my steps carefully, so I could get some little piece of my life
  back.  My mission is to rare awareness of invisible illnesses, I am a
  patient advocate but now can only do house calls I can't make it in a
  hospital, to far to walk.  I work with patients that have invisible
  illnesses and need a ear to listen, someone who gets it, I also teach
  journaling and guided imagery to PTSD patients even veterans.  My life
  has always been about helping others,  But I can't unless by phone
  now.  The dream of being able to go outside and go around the block is
  huge, something some people will take for granite.  Making a
  difference in someones life is my life but this bike could help me
  help even more people and this bike could help others as well.  Please
  help me help others.",https://fundrazr.com/11W4S4

  were clear, except for a spot on his liver.  He now has a schedule for
  his treatments and possibly some surgery going forward. Several people have asked how can they help. If you feel lead to help

32,"9,038",Zach Branson Liver Transplant Fund,U.S. Dollar,, $50k ,73.0,"Zachary Branson was born with a liver disease known as biliary
  atresia. The main procedure that was performed is known as a Kasai
  portoenterostomy. This operation connects the bile drainage from the
  liver directly to the intestinal tract. Success of this procedure may
  be improved when it is done before an infant is 8 weeks old. The Kasai
  procedure is helpful because it permits bile to flow and can allow a
  child to grow and remain in fairly good health for many years. It is
  important to understand that this surgery is typically a treatment for
  and not cure of biliary atresia. Ongoing liver disease is likely to
  continue to occur even with a successful operation. Up to 80 percent
  of children who undergo the Kasai portoenterostomy will eventually
  need to have a liver transplant. Doctors warned that Zach would not
  live past the age of 2 years old. Now at 32.5 years old, Zach has
  surprised the medical community. He has gone through quite rough times
  in his life growing up with this disease. His mother passed away in
  2006 from liver and kidney failure due to alcoholism. Zach cannot work
  a ""normal"" job anymore due to complications that arise from
  this disease. He is currently in the process of fighting for
  disability. The application status is pending. We are asking to share
  this page with everyone you know. Encourage your loved ones and
  friends to become an organ and tissue donor. If you have been blessed
  enough in life to allow yourself to make a donation to this brave,

  have now classified as stage 4 colon cancer , Chris
  will be receiving follow-up chemotherapy treatment beginning March 27
  at City of Hope. During the first phase of treatment, a small spot on
  her liver grew to the size of a quarter. It was successfully excised
  in surgery, along with her gallbladder and approximately 13 inches of
  colon. But, due to the extremely aggressive nature of this cancer
  (which actually GREW during radiation), her doctors feel this course
  of follow-up treatment is vital to giving her the best possible chance
  at a full recovery. THANK YOU for your continued support of our dear friend! How you can help: Donate here to Chris's ongoing care while she is
      in treatment and unable to work. Share this page on social media and with others who may be moved to help: fundrazr.com/ChrisStrother Book a family photo shoot with Chris - contact her

    shock to us all. If anyone is a survivor, Chris Strother is the ultimate!  But we
    know that the cancer is aggressive and she must move forward
    rapidly. Chris is preparing to undergo conventional cancer treatment
    while continuing to support her overall health with a variety of
    integrative & complementary therapies. During the coming months, Chris will be unable to work at her
    normal capacity. As a single mom, she is very aware that this means
    she will need help. If you know Chris, you know that accepting this
    kind of help does not come easy for her. But, we have convinced her
    that relieving some of her financial burden will allow her to focus
    all of her energy on healing. Our goal is to raise funds to cover
    one year of medical and living expenses. We are hoping to raise funds to help her with medical co-pays;
    living expenses; integrative nutrition; ongoing expenses for her
    son, Eli; and complementary therapies that are not covered by insurance. Chris is a precious and inspiring friend to many, a true renaissance
  woman with extraordinary gifts to further bring to our world. We are
  inviting her friends, fans, and community to support her during this
  challenging time. We want her to know that we are here for her, as she
  has been for so many of us.",https://fundrazr.com/ChrisStrother
34,"31,090",Urgent Support Needed for Tony Dowling's Cancer Journey!,Australian Dollar,, $60k ,83.0,"Hi, my names Matt my wife and I have been friends with Tony and Tracy for nearly twenty
    years. They are a beautiful family and it was such a shock when I
    got the call from Tony recently telling me of his cancer diagnosis! I’m sure most of you have been following his journey as we have
    and are sending a constant stream of love, positive thoughts and
    prayers their way. I spoke again with Tony last week and heard the n ews of
    the new diagnosis and upgrade from stage 1 to stage 4. Truly heartbreaking to hear, but Tony is as positive and
    faith-filled as always, a true inspiration, we stand strong with
    them believing for a full recovery! He told me briefly of some of the struggles of dealing with the
    unexpected expenses and also the obvious loss of income etc. but
    expressed that he knows that God has it all under control and that he is confident of a positive outcome. After our chat I got off the phone and probably like many of you
    who are not physically located near Tony and Tracy in Sydney
    Australia, I thought to myself, there has to be something we can do to help, so I have set up this campaign in
    the hope that you will all join us in standing together to help make
    a massive difference to Tonys journey! Following is a snapshot of the Dowling family, a link to Tony’s
    journey so far which you can follow and the reasons why our
    donations are so very vital and impactful at this time for them... Tony is 46 years old and has been married to
  Tracy for 19 yrs. They live on the northern beaches of Sydney with
  their two boys Max 16 and Noah 14. The family is heavily involved in
  local basketball through the boy's school and the Manly representative
  level comps. Tracy is involved at the boy's school and helps
  co-ordinate and manage multiple basketball teams. Tony has a background as a school teacher,
  business entrepreneur and currently works in training and software
  development. They are active members of the local community, and
  church and love travelling, family time and adventures of any kind. Tony and Tracy have impacted the lives of so many people around the
  globe and locally with their big hearts and generous souls. We all have been positively influenced by this amazing couple in some
  shape or form, through either school, community, business or church
    life. Here is a link where you can follow Tony’s journey and progress: https://www.mylifeline.org/invitation/FOTY/b53c54fcc2abfed6f3d977439df0c4c309e98f36fff675b0772a480f52894be2 How we can help: Tony has just had surgery to remove bowel cancer which has also
  spread to his right lung. Tony’s diagnosis has now jumped from stage 1 to stage 4! This means that it is full steam ahead for aggressive chemotherapy
  treatment for the next 6 mths, followed by lung surgery around
  November 2019. They are in the process of trying to access some insurance funds, but
  there is a 3 mth waiting period that is not covered and then funds
  will still only cover 3/4 of normal income. On top of that, there are all the additional medical bills, hospital
  expenses, gap payments, medications and day to day additional expenses
  that come with this type of treatment... We want Tony, Tracy and the boys to be able to focus on the important
  things and keep any additional stress to a minimum. We would like to
  provide enough to get them through this 4 month transition period and
  also give them a buffer so that there is not a financial burden and
  pressure on them over the next 6 months. We would like to enable Tracy to not have to take up any additional
  work to cover any shortfall and added expenses, but be able to spend
  the time with Tony and attend to all the necessary appointments and
  give him all the required care and attention needed at this time. After calculating the amount needed to cover their everyday expenses
  keeping them afloat and to keep life as normal as possible, plus
  enough to help cover their ongoing medical costs for the next 6
  months, we have set a goal to raise $60K. Anything above that will go towards any additional ongoing medical
  expenses and treatment required. We kindly ask you to consider donating to help bless Tony
        and his family at this time as they link arms and stand together
        with friends, and family near and far to fight this nasty thing
        head on! If we all give what we can and share this with our various
        friends and networks then Tony and His family’s journey will be
        made so much easier by us all joining together to show how much
        we care! Thank you all for your thoughts, prayers and generous donations... God Bless!!",https://fundrazr.com/f1TtQ0

      this campaign. All funds donated to this campaign go directly into
      Jesse and Greg's bank account only they have access to. Jessica Russman and I have been friends since we were kids.
      We are more like family. I can't remember a time when I've called
      upon her and she has not come through for me. Now SHE needs
      assistance, and I want within all my power to be at her aide. This
      one is going to take the Village though. Jesse was diagnosed with stage 3 liver cancer several months
      ago and though a successful ablation the cancer was killed, due to
      other illnesses Jesse’s liver does not regenerate. Unfortunately
      she needs a full transplant before the cancer comes back. She is
      currently on the wait list and unable to work. It takes all the
      energy she can muster to spend quality time carrying for her
      beautiful 2 year old daughter Selena. Jesse’s husband Greg is an
      amazing man and has been her rock throughout all of this while
      maintaining all the financial and household responsibilities. Needless to say the medical bills are piling up and becoming
      insurmountable. The Russman’s need help to get over this mountain
      they are about to climb? Cancer is a wicked disease that gives no
      acknowledgement to age or personal circumstance. A liver
      transplant is Jesse's only hope of survival. Jesse and Greg live 90 miles away from the nearest hospital.
      So they have to stay in a hotel with Selena when Jesse has
      treatments.  When Jesse has her transplant she will be in the
      hospital for a month and then it will take 4 to 6 months of
      recovery at home. They will need some in home care for Selena and
      Jesse so Greg can work. Greg can take a leave from work to care
      for them, but he would have to go unpaid. Any help is appreciated.",https://fundrazr.com/JesseRussman
